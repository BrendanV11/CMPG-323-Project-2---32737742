# Project-2---API-Development
<p>This project use user authentication so you need to log in with a user and authorize that user to use operate freely</p>

<h3>Endpoints</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Get</li>
    <li>Post</li>
    <li>Get {id}</li>
    <li>Put {id}</li>
    <li>Delete {id}</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>To use Get</h3>
  <p>Just execute the get command to run it. Get simply retrieves all the data within the relevant controller being used. For instance if you were to use the get within the Device controller, all the data that has been posted (Using the post) will be retrieved and displayed</p>
  
 <h3>To use Post</h3>
  <p>To execute the post command you will need to enter the data that is relevant to the controller you are posting to. For example when posting to Category you will need to specify the categoryId, categoryName, categoryDescription, and dateCreated </p>

 <h3>To use Get {id}</h3>
<p>Using get with the id simply retrieves the data at a certain index and returns it</p>

 <h3>To use Put {id}</h3>
<p>Put recieves the id that is provided and then updates the values of the element from that index and sets it equal to the new updated version that you provide</p>

 <h3>To use Delete {id}</h3>
<p>Delete simply removes the element at the index that the id points to</p>

<h2>Steps tp follow:</h2>

    <li>After access has been granted you now have authorization to use the endpoints freely</li>
</ol>
